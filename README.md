YADB is a SQL database written in modern C++, built from scratch as an
educational project. YADB is focused on being simple, functional, and correct. As a result,
performance and scalability are intentionally *not* the top prioritiesâ€”clarity
and educational value come first.

## Blog Series

While I'm building YADB, I figured that it would be a good exercise to document
my progress and share some of the design decisions I made along the way.
You can check out the blog [here](https://www.erichayter.com/yadb-docs/).

## Building

1. Clone the repository and submodules:
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/EricHayter/yadb
```

2. Build using CMake:
```bash
cd yadb
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

---

## Usage

yadb currently doesn't include a standalone executable to run queries against.
However, tests can be built and run for the components implemented so far.

```
# From the build/ directory
cmake --build . --target yadb_test
./tests/yadb_test
```

---

## Roadmap

- [x] Set up blog
- [x] Implement disk manager
- [x] Implement disk scheduler
- [x] Implement page buffer
- [ ] Implement slotted page interface
- [ ] Implement B+ trees
- [ ] TBD
